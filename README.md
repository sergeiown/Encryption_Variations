# [Base64 and XOR Console Encryptors](https://sergeiown.github.io/Encryption_Variations/)

## Description.
This project implements console interfaces for encoding and decoding text using different encryption methods: base64 and XOR. Each interface supports text input in Cyrillic and Latin and the ability to save the results to a text file.

## Base64 Interface:

**Functionality:**
1. Converting text to base64 format.
2. Deconvert base64 to plain text.
3. Checking for the correctness of the base64 code.
4. Ability to save the results to a file.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script in the terminal or use the appropriate bat file if you are using a windows environment.
2. Enter the text to encode and decode or use input.txt (for the *FromFile.js script).
3. The results are displayed in the console, the session history is saved to the output.txt file.

***A web version of the application is now also available: https://sergeiown.github.io/Encryption_Variations/***

## XOR Interface:

**Functionality:**.
1. Converts text using the XOR method with the specified key.
2. Decode the text encrypted by the XOR method using the key.
3. Checking the correctness of the text encrypted by the XOR method.
4. Ability to save the results to a file.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script in the terminal or use the appropriate bat file if you are using a windows environment..
2. Enter the text to encode and decode or use input.txt (for the *FromFile.js script).
3. The results are displayed in the console, the session history is saved to the output.txt file.

### Technical requirements:
1. Availability of Node.js.
2. Access to the file system.

## Remarks:
Both scripts can be used as examples for implementing console interfaces for encoding and decoding text.
